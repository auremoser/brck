BRCK Reports
============

sketches for brck project

###What is this?
This is a simple chart and card view of the brck checkin google form. Viz ports through google so you will need to be logged in and have access to the mail account associated with your form submissions every week.

###How does it work?
* [google form](https://docs.google.com/a/ushahidi.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au01_KBZmcHudFhRNWZmdzVRSE1xc00xOUFEN0xFUFE&usp=sharing#gid=2) answers are mapped to this page, but the layout differs
* at left, all numerical values from the form responses are charted as a bar chart (scale 0-5)
* tooltips show values and everything alphabetizes by team member
* at right (or below, depending on your screen size), small summary cards report the remaining form info by team member (again, alphabetical)
* scroll at the right to view more answers on the cards; hover over bars to read values.
* each week, this link will update with the latest reports as of sunday night (evening before call -- get your responses in by **10pm** please)
